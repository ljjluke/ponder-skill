# General Decision Policy

## Overview

This policy file defines general decision simulation rules, applicable to any domain. **This is a reference file; for complete rules during engine execution, refer to engine files in `engine/` directory**:

| Topic | Reference File (More Detailed) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Diverge/Solution Generation | [`engine/mcts-diverge.md`](../engine/mcts-diverge.md) |
| Round-by-round Simulation | [`engine/mcts-simulate.md`](../engine/mcts-simulate.md) |
| Aggregate/Self-check/Blindspot Audit | [`engine/mcts-converge.md`](../engine/mcts-converge.md) |

This file contains:
1. Solution generation rules (don't list solutions from thin air, extract from resources)
2. Simulation output standardized format
3. Scoring standards (what counts as 0.8, what counts as 0.3)
4. Aggregate comparison rules
5. Policy function selection guide
6. Value function persistence format

## Solution Generation Rules

Solutions are not thought up from thin air, must be based on one of the following sources:

### Solution Sources and Basis

| Source | Basis Type | Credibility | Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Existing project code | Directly see existing implementation in project | HIGH | "Project already uses gin-jwt middleware, extend on that basis" |
| Technical documentation | Official docs or accepted best practices | HIGH | "JWT official recommends using Redis blacklist for token management" |
| Knowledge graph (K00X) | Historical successful experience, context matches | MED-HIGH | "K003 succeeded with same pattern in similar scenario" |
| Industry standards | Widely used but no direct docs available | MED | "Most APIs use RESTful conventions" |
| Analogical reasoning | Derived from other domains/tech stacks | LOW | "In Go this is handled this way, analogous to Python should be similar" |

### Solution Description Format

```
Solution A: [Name]
  Basis: [Source Type] [Specific Reference]
  Approach: [One-sentence core approach]
  Cost: [Low/Medium/High]

Solution B: [Name]
  Basis: [Source Type] [Specific Reference]
  Approach: [One-sentence core approach]
  Cost: [Low/Medium/High]
```

### Solution Diversity Rules

```
Minimum 4 solutions, maximum 8 (Perspective Wheel mechanism, 1 solution per perspective).
Solutions must have substantial difference (must be different perspectives,
not just different parameters).

Good Example:
  Solution A: "Extend based on project's existing gin-jwt middleware"
    (Basis: Project code)
  Solution B: "Switch to OAuth2, use separate auth service"
    (Basis: Technical docs)
  → Two solutions have essential difference

Bad Example:
  Solution A: "Use gin-jwt middleware"
  Solution B: "Also use gin-jwt but add Redis"
  → Essentially the same solution, just different details
  → Merge into one solution
```

## Simulation Output Format

After each solution simulation completes, must output report in following standard format:

### Complete Simulation Report Template

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Simulated Solution: [Solution Name]
Knowledge Injection:
  - Value Function: [Referenced historical entries]
  - Decision Pattern: [Referenced success/failure patterns]
  - Context: [Relevant current session knowledge]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: [Starting Action]
  → Operation Description: [Specifically what to do]
  → Target Files: [Involved file paths]
  → Expected Result: [Success/Partial success]
  → Difficulty: [Low/Medium/High]
  → Time Estimate: [How many steps or operations]

Step 2: [Critical Path]
  → Path Description: [Causal chain of subsequent steps]

    • Risk 1: [Description] → Probability:[High/Medium/Low] →
              Response:[Fallback solution]
    • Risk 2: [Description] → Probability:[High/Medium/Low] →
              Response:[Fallback solution]
  → Branch Points: [If choices exist, anticipate here]

Step 3: [Endpoint Assessment]
  → Final Result: [Expected completion state]
  → Side Effects: [Other modules possibly affected]

─── Simulation Score ───
  Expected Value V (0.0~1.0):
  Variance σ² (0.0~1.0):
  Confidence Level: [High(σ²<0.1) / Medium(σ²<0.3) / Low(σ²≥0.3)]
  Top 3 Key Risks:
    1. [Risk + Impact Level]
    2. [Risk + Impact Level]
    3. [Risk + Impact Level]
  Recommendation: [Strongly Recommended / Recommended / Optional / Not Recommended]
```

### Quick Simulation Report Template (for rough filter stage)

```
Solution: [Name]
Feasibility: [0-1]
Cost-Benefit: [0-1]
Risk: [0-1]
Rough Filter Score: = Feasibility×0.5 + Cost-Benefit×0.3 + (1-Risk)×0.2
Keep/Eliminate: [Keep / Eliminate]
```

---

## Scoring Standards

### Expected Value V (0.0~1.0)

```
V = 1.0: Solution perfect, no side effects, success in one attempt
V = 0.9: Solution excellent, may have minor adjustments, overall smooth
V = 0.8: Solution good, expect 1-2 minor bumps
V = 0.7: Solution feasible, some risk but controllable
V = 0.6: Solution barely feasible, need cautious execution
V = 0.5: Neutral, may or may not work, need more info
V = 0.4: Solution has significant uncertainty, may have hidden issues
V = 0.3: Solution high risk, not recommended
V = 0.2: Solution likely to fail
V = 0.1: Solution basically infeasible
V = 0.0: Solution completely infeasible
```

### Variance σ² (0.0~1.0)

```
σ² = 0.0~0.05: Highly certain (similar tasks done many times)
σ² = 0.05~0.15: Fairly certain
σ² = 0.15~0.30: Some uncertainty
σ² = 0.30~0.50: Uncertain
σ² = 0.50~1.00: Highly uncertain (first attempt)

Variance Sources:
  - Low variance: Matches historical success pattern + Current context clear
  - Medium variance: Partial history match + Context has fuzzy points
  - High variance: No history match + Complex context + New tech stack
```

### Confidence Level

| σ² Range | Confidence Level | Meaning |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| < 0.1 | High | Simulation result credible, can execute confidently |
| 0.1 ~ 0.3 | Medium | Simulation result reference-worthy, but watch for surprises |
| ≥ 0.3 | Low | Simulation result for reference only, suggest collecting more info |

## Aggregate Comparison Rules

### Summary Table Format

After all solutions simulated, output aggregate comparison table:

```
┌───────────┬───────┬────────┬────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Solution  │ Value │ Variance│ Confidence │ Key Risks                │
├───────────┼───────┼────────┼────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ SolutionA │ 0.85  │ 0.05   │ High       │ Depends on external API  │
│ SolutionB │ 0.72  │ 0.18   │ Medium     │ Large change scope,      │
│           │       │        │            │ affects 3 modules        │
│ SolutionC │ 0.91  │ 0.08   │ High       │ Need to introduce new    │
│           │       │        │            │ dependency               │
└───────────┴───────┴────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────────┘

CLT-UCB: `node scripts/mcts_compute.js` compute_clt_ucb
φ⁻¹(N): N=2→1.5, 3→1.0, 4→0.8, 5→0.7, n_i is solution simulation count
```

### Handling Close Rankings

## Policy Function Selection Guide

Ported from tetris_mcts's policy module, select different policies by stage:

### Rough Filter Stage Policy

| Policy | Applicable Scenario | Rule |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| policy_greedy | When solutions > 8 | Take top-3~5 with highest rough filter scores |
| policy_random | Need multi-angle exploration | Randomly select 5 solutions (ensure diversity) |

### Aggregate Comparison Stage Policy

| Policy | Applicable Scenario | Formula |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| policy_clt (recommended) | Has variance info | UCB = V + Φ⁻¹(N) × √(σ²/n_i) |
| policy_max | No variance info | UCB = V + max_σ² × √(ln(N)/n_i) |
| policy_greedy | High confidence | UCB = V (directly select highest value) |

### Re-simulation Stage Policy

| Policy | Applicable Scenario | Rule |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| policy_greedy | Execution blocked | Directly select 2nd ranked solution |
| policy_clt | Need re-evaluation | Recalculate all solutions' UCB
                            (new info may have changed variance) |

## Value Function Table

| task_type | domain | risk_level | Visits(n) | Success(w) | Mean(q) | Variance(σ²) | Confidence | Last Updated |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|------|---------|
| BUG_FIX | WEB | LOW | 47 | 44 | 0.936 | 0.05 | HIGH | 2026-06-03 |
| FEATURE | API | MED | 12 | 9 | 0.750 | 0.18 | MED | 2026-06-02 |
| REFACTOR | DB | HIGH | 3 | 1 | 0.333 | 0.42 | LOW | 2026-06-01 |

## Decision Sequence Patterns

### Success Patterns
  - BUG_FIX|WEB: recon → read_target → edit → test → verify
  - FEATURE|API: recon → plan → search_deps → edit_with_deps → test_all

### Failure Patterns
  - DEBUG|GENERAL: Skip recon, modify directly → High probability failure
  - FEATURE|DB: Modify all files at once → High probability conflicts

## Cross-session Knowledge
  - [2026-06-01] User preference: Prefers defensive programming style
  - [2026-06-02] Project constraint: DB layer not allowed to use third-party libs directly
```

### Update Rules

```
After execution completes, execute TD update:
  1. Collect actual results:
     - Did compile/test pass
     - Did it achieve expected effect
     - Any side effects
     - Key tech stacks and frameworks involved
  
  2. Calculate TD error:
     V_actual = Actual result score (0.0~1.0)
     V_simulated = Expected value during simulation
     TD_error = V_actual - V_simulated
  
  3. Update knowledge graph:
     Execute multi-path recall, find matching knowledge entries:
     
     If matching entry found:
       - Update n, q, σ² (using Welford)
       - Consolidation score += 5
       - Update last_verified
       - Check if status needs transition (based on TD_error magnitude
         and direction)
     
     If no match found:
       - Create new HYPOTHESIS entry
       - Extract tags keywords from task description
       - Record current context (tech stack, frameworks, etc.)
       - Initial values: q=V_actual, σ²=0.25, n=1
       - Assign new ID (incrementing)
  
  4. Update decision sequence patterns:
     If successful: Record execution path to "Success Patterns"
     If failed: Record execution path to "Failure Patterns"
  
  5. Write to memory file
