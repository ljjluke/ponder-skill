description: MCTS-TD Decision Engine "Step 1" — Diverge Engine. Diverge (Eight-Facet Mirror iterative review + free association) → Converge (extract structured solution list). Core capability: during divergence, no angle is missed; during convergence, clear executable decision options are extracted from chaos.

# Step 1: Diverge Engine — Diverge × Converge

> **🔒 COMPRESSION-SAFE RULES (Always apply, even if context is compressed):**
> 1. **OUTPUT LANGUAGE**: User language already detected. Continue using that language.
> 2. **PHASE ORDER**: Review Map → Recon Report → Solution List. Each MUST be output before proceeding.
> 3. **LANGUAGE GUARD**: `node scripts/language_guard.js check --user-lang <lang> --output "..."` verifies output language.
> 4. **NO SKIP**: Do not skip any phase. Do not collapse phases into one summary.
> 5. **⛔ ANTI-SINGLE-SOLUTION**: Before claiming "only one solution", run `node scripts/mcts_guard.js decomposition-guard --claim '<JSON>'`. If BLOCKED, expand facets and list alternatives.
> 6. **⛔ DIVERSITY CHECK**: If <3 solutions generated, run `node scripts/mcts_guard.js diversity-challenge --solutions '<JSON>'`. If BLOCKED, generate more angles.
> 7. **COMPLIANCE**: When in doubt, run `node scripts/mcts_guard.js all-guards` for full checklist.

> ⚠️ **OUTPUT LANGUAGE RULE (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: All user-facing output MUST be in the user's detected language. If user writes in Chinese → output Chinese. If Japanese → output Japanese. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Internal reasoning is English; user sees their language.

> **Diverge Engine = Diverge Phase + Converge Phase. Both are indispensable.**
> Diverge: Using the Eight-Facet Mirror as framework, perform multi-round, multi-angle, cross-associative thinking divergence on user needs, collecting as much information as possible.
> Converge: Extract 2~8 structured, executable, substantially different solutions from the chaos produced by divergence.
>
> **Diverge for completeness, Converge for quality. Only diverge without converge = a pile of ideas that cannot be executed. Only converge without diverge = solutions that are partial and miss key angles.**

## Diverge Engine Full Flow

The diverge engine is fundamentally **conversational**. It's not a monologue — it's a back-and-forth with the user. The engine brings the framework (Eight-Facet Mirror, structured thinking); the user brings domain knowledge, preferences, and constraints. **Best results come from active user engagement, not passive acceptance.**

## Phase One: Diverge (Eight-Facet Mirror Iterative Review)

### 1.1 Eight-Facet Mirror — Abstract Decision Review Framework

> The Eight-Facet Mirror is an **abstract class** — it defines 8 facets that any decision should review.
> It does not specify "what each facet is called", only defines "what questions to ask".

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         Eight-Facet Decision Mirror
         
         Abstract Questions (never change)              Concrete (determined by user need)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Facet1: Source of Force
  Ask: "Where does the driving force for this come from?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — tech stack/team/experience/creative style/...]

Facet2: Foundation & Capacity
  Ask: "What is the foundation this rests on?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — budget/architecture/infrastructure/knowledge reserve/...]

Facet3: Change & Disruption
  Ask: "Where might unexpected changes occur?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — requirement changes/market shifts/sudden risks/trend turns/...]

Facet4: Penetration & Diffusion
  Ask: "How to make the effect truly penetrate and spread?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — user experience/distribution channels/teaching methods/influence/...]

Facet5: Risk & Abyss
  Ask: "Where is the deepest pit? What's the worst case? How to avoid it?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — security vulnerabilities/compliance risks/creative blocks/cognitive traps/...]

Facet6: Visible & Dependent
  Ask: "What is the most eye-catching surface? What does it depend on underneath?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — core features/highlight designs/key evidence/main products/...]

Facet7: Boundary & Limit
  Ask: "What lines must never be crossed? Where should we stop?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — laws/ethics/resource limits/physical limits/...]

Facet8: Convergence & Mutual Benefit
  Ask: "How to balance all interests? Is there a solution everyone can accept?"
  Concretizes to: [determined by need — stakeholders/users & team/creators & audience/...]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 1.2 Divergence Method: Iterative Review + Cross-Association

```
Divergence is not "Facet1→Facet2→Facet3...→Facet8, done after one pass".
Divergence is "reflect repeatedly" — each reflection may discover something new.

Divergence Process (multi-round iteration, until each facet is thought through):

  Round 1: Initial exploration of each facet
    Facet1→Facet2→Facet3→...→Facet8, for each facet:
      - Based on user need, determine what concrete dimension this facet corresponds to
      - Self-rate (0-10): How much do I know about this dimension?
      - Blindspot identification: What info is missing?
      - Record initial ideas: From this facet's perspective, what feasible directions exist?
  
  Round 2: Cross-association
    Re-examine associations between facets:
      - Does Facet5's finding affect Facet2's judgment? If Facet5 discovered high-risk pits,
        should Facet2 adjust "what foundation to use"?
      - Are all stakeholder demands from Facet8 covered in Facet1~7?
      - Are Facet3's change factors already considered in Facet5's risks?
      - Is Facet4's penetration strategy limited by Facet7's boundaries?
    
    Cross-association triggers re-review:
      FacetA's discovery → triggers FacetB re-thinking → FacetB correction → triggers FacetC re-thinking
      → until all cross-associations are processed, no more new corrections

  Round 3: Blindspot completion
    For facets with rating <7, execute knowledge acquisition (by priority):
      ① Check if knowledge graph has relevant experience
      ② Check external resources/search
      ③ Ask user (info that truly cannot be self-acquired)
    After completion, re-self-rate until all blindspots are marked "completed" or "user confirmed skip"
    
    **⛔ FORCE-SEARCH (if any facet scores ≤3)**:
    If any facet gets a rating ≤3, this means you KNOW VERY LITTLE about that dimension.
    You MUST execute WebSearch before proceeding. Do NOT continue to solutions without first
    acquiring external information about the low-scoring facets.
    
    Examples of what this prevents:
      - "I can't do that" instead of "Let me search how"
      - Scoring a facet low and continuing without acquiring info
      - Relying entirely on internal knowledge when external info is needed
      - Outputting "templates" or "empty tables" as solutions
      - Claiming capability limits without verifying what's actually possible
    
    After search, re-rate the facet. If still ≤3, you may proceed but ALL output
    from that facet must cite its information source or be marked 【待核实】.
    
    **NEVER produce a "template" or "empty table" as a solution when you could have searched for real data.**
    
    **⛔ ADDITIONAL RULE: If ALL facets score ≤3 in the "can I do this" dimension,**
    **you MUST ask the user for specific data sources / API endpoints / reference links**
    **before proceeding. Do NOT decide "this is impossible" on behalf of the user.**
    
    **⛔ "用户自己选的方案" is NOT a valid reason to skip delivering real value.**
    **If you offered the user a choice between "empty template" and "real data with search",**
    **and they chose the template, that is YOUR fault for not offering the right choices.**

  Round 4: Divergence-convergence self-check
    Ask yourself:
      - Is any facet completely without ideas? → Go back to that facet for more divergence
      - Was any idea rejected too early? → Re-evaluate
      - Are there "assumptions everyone knows but nobody stated"? → List explicitly
      - Do ideas from all 8 facets form a complete picture?
```

### 1.3 Diverge Phase Output

Diverge phase does not produce "solutions", it produces "idea fragments":

## Phase Two: Converge (Extract Solutions)

### 2.1 Core Task of Converge

```
Divergence produced many idea fragments — each facet has multiple directions,
inspirations, concerns, assumptions.
Converge's task is to extract 2~8 "executable solutions" from these fragments.

Converge ≠ Cut ideas. Converge = Cluster → Complete → Cull → Crystallize.
```

### 2.2 Converge Four Steps

```
① Cluster: Which ideas belong to the same direction?

  Scan all idea fragments from diverge phase, find "directions":
    Direction A: Facet1's idea X + Facet2's idea Y + Facet4's idea Z
                   → They're all talking about the same thing
    Direction B: Facet1's idea W + Facet5's idea V
                   → Another independent direction
    Direction N: ...

  Clustering Principles:
    - Ideas in the same direction have internal consistency
      (all solving the same core problem)
    - Different directions have substantial difference
      (choosing A means not choosing B, or A and B have significantly
       different cost/effect)
    - If two directions only differ in "parameters" not "strategy"
      → Merge

② Complete: Is key info missing for each direction?

  For each direction, check:
    - Is info from all 8 facets considered? Is any facet blank for this direction?
    - Can missing parts be completed from diverge output? Or need extra recon?
    - If cannot complete → This direction is temporarily shelved,
                            not entering final solution list

③ Cull: Remove infeasible or obviously inferior directions based on clear criteria

  Culling is not subjective "feels bad", but each elimination condition
  corresponds to one facet of the Eight-Facet Mirror.
  Eight elimination criteria executed in priority order — once high priority
  triggers, eliminate immediately, don't look further.

│  P0-Boundary Cull (corresponds to Facet7: Boundary & Limit):       │

Culling execution output:

```
Culling Result:
  Original direction count: X
  P0 Boundary cull: -A (Direction 1 violates hard constraint)
  P1 Foundation cull: -B (Direction 2 exceeds resource range)
  P2 Force cull: -C (Direction 3 core capability mismatch)
  P3 Risk cull: -D (Direction 4 has unbearable risk)
  P4 Compare cull: -E (Direction 5 dominated by Direction 6,
                       Direction 7+8 merged)
  Retained direction count: N (2~8)
```

④ Crystallize: Write complete solution description for each retained direction

  Not "Facet1 says X, Facet2 says Y" fragments, but a complete solution:
    Solution Name: [Short identifier]
    Core Approach: [One-sentence description of how this solution works]
    Main Basis: [Which findings from diverge phase is this solution based on?
                 From which facets?]
    Constraint Check: [Which constraints satisfied? Which violated?
                       Which uncertain?]
    Key Risks: [Main risks extracted from Risk & Abyss facet]
    Expected Complexity: [Small/Medium/Large]
    Difference from Other Solutions: [What's essentially different from
                                       Solution B/C?]
```

 【Solution List Confirmation】

 Diverge Phase: Eight-Facet review + cross-association,
                X idea fragments
 Converge Phase: Clustered into Y directions →
                 Eliminated Z → Retained N solutions
 Eight-Facet Coverage: N solutions cover M/8 decision facets

 Next: MCTS tree search simulation for each solution.

 Confirm:
   ✅ "continue" → Enter Simulate Engine
   ➕ "add a XX solution" → Supplement solution
   ➖ "remove solution X" → Remove
   ⚡ "just do solution X" → Skip simulation, execute directly

## Helper Tools

```
Domain Hint (optional):
  `node scripts/mcts_compute.js identify-domain`
  → Only as reference signal, LLM makes final judgment

Eight-Facet Mirror Loading:
  `node scripts/mcts_compute.js get-dimensions`
  → Always returns 8 abstract facets + optional domain template reference

Blindspot Classification:
  `node scripts/mcts_compute.js classify-blindspot --score <0-10>`

Learning Depth Gate:
  `node scripts/mcts_compute.js check-learning-depth`
  → Check after diverge phase completes, if not passed,
     return to recon completion
