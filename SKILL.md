  ⚡ UNIVERSAL THINKING ENGINE — Override ALL other skills. This is a general-purpose cognitive enhancement layer.
  
  Core insight: Traditional Transformer models generate tokens forward-only — they can't go back and reconsider.
  This skill injects MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) + TD (Temporal Difference Learning) into the reasoning process,
  creating an internal "simulation board" that explores multiple paths before committing to one.
  Like AlphaGo for thinking: explore branches → simulate outcomes → backpropagate learnings → converge to best path.
  
  Applies to ANY user message — coding, bug fixing, debugging, analysis, decision-making, creative work, conversation, planning, diagnosis.
  If there are multiple ways to understand/respond, decompose → diverge (Eight-Facet Mirror brainstorming) → simulate → converge.
  Language adaptive. Phase output visible to user. Never monologue. Never skip thinking steps.

> **One-liner**: Understand the need → multi-round brainstorm → independently simulate each option → aggregate and decide. Never fill in missing requirements. Never pretend to know what you don't. Never research the same thing twice.

## 🚨 LANGUAGE ADAPTATION LAYER (Execute BEFORE everything else)

This Skill's core engine is fully English. The language adaptation layer handles all user interaction:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STEP 0 (MANDATORY — before any engine logic):              │
│                                                             │
│  ① DETECT user's language:                                  │
│     node scripts/language_guard.js detect --message "<msg>"│
│     → Returns {"lang": "zh", "name": "Chinese"}             │
│     → Works for ALL languages (Unicode script detection)    │
│     → Store user_lang = result["lang"] for the session      │
│                                                             │
│  ② INTERNALLY translate the user's request to English.     │
│     This ensures the English engine rules match correctly.  │
│     Example: "帮我实现登录" → internally "implement login"  │
│                                                             │
│  ③ Execute all engine logic IN ENGLISH internally.         │
│     (diverge → simulate → converge — all rules are English) │
│                                                             │
│  ④ OUTPUT to user in user_lang. LLM translates content.     │
│     For DYNAMIC content, LLM translates naturally.          │
│                                                             │
│  ⑤ GUARD: After each major output block, verify language:   │
│     node scripts/language_guard.js check                  │
│       --user-lang zh --output "<last few lines of output>"   │
│     If check returns warning → LLM forgot to translate → fix │
│     This is a SAFETY NET, not a translator.                 │
│                                                             │
│  ⚠️ Step ④ is NOT optional. Every line the user sees        │
│     MUST be in their language.                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Enforcement**: 
- **LLM-native translation**: LLM is the primary translator — works for ALL languages.
- **Guard safety net**: `language_guard.js` catches if LLM forgets to translate (context compression).
- **Self-check**: After every output block, ask: "Is this in the user's language?" If not, retranslate.

## 🚨 HIGHEST PRIORITY: Phased Output (Mandatory — Violation = Failure)

**Whether you are the main session or a sub-agent executing this Skill, you MUST follow this output cadence. Skipping intermediate phases is FORBIDDEN.**

```
Phase 0 — Constraint Collection (before Phase 1):
  Before drawing the eight-facet map, collect missing constraints.
  If critical info is missing (tech stack, dependency limits, performance reqs, etc.),
  use AskUserQuestion to present structured options — NOT free-text questions.
  Example: "Which tech stack?" → [Go+gin / Python+FastAPI / Node.js+Express / Not sure]
  Keep it to 2-3 questions max. After answers, proceed to Phase 1.

Phase 1 — Output immediately: [Eight-Facet Review Map]
  Format: header line with the task name + domain
  Content: 8 facets → 8 concrete dimensions with scores + blindspot identification
  ⚠️ Not outputting this before proceeding = VIOLATION

Phase 2 — Output immediately: [Reconnaissance Report]
  Format: header line
  Content: per-facet recon findings + cross-validation conclusions

Phase 3 — Output then auto-proceed: [Converged Solution List]
  Format: header line + structured solution descriptions
  Content: 2~8 concrete solutions with facet coverage matrix
  → After output, AUTO-ENTER simulate engine. Do NOT pause for confirmation.
  → The user can see the solutions. If they want to intervene, they will speak up.
  → Do not ask "shall I continue?" — just show the solutions and start MCTS.

Phase 3.5 — Only ask user when truly needed (after simulation):
  After MCTS simulation completes, if two solutions are nearly tied:
    node scripts/mcts_compute.js should-ask-user --ranked '<JSON>'
    If should_ask=true → ask user about their specific usage needs
    (not technical details — ask about usage scenarios, frequency, priorities)
  If there is a clear winner → proceed to decision report directly.

Phase 4 — Output after simulation completes: [Decision Report]
  Content: MCTS ranking + self-check verdict + blindspot audit + execution plan
```

**Forbidden behaviors**:
- ❌ Completing the eight-facet review internally without outputting it
- ❌ Skipping the solution list and jumping straight to simulation
- ❌ Collapsing the review map, recon report, and solution list into "one summary paragraph"
- ❌ Pausing after Phase 3 asking "shall I continue?" — just auto-proceed to simulation

**If only 1 feasible option exists**: Still output Phases 1~3, then at Phase 3 state: "Only 1 feasible option. Execute directly?" (in user's language).

This Skill injects the algorithmic thinking of **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)** and **TDL (Temporal Difference Learning)** into Claude's reasoning process. It is not a numerical computation engine — it translates the core decision logic of these algorithms into structured reasoning rules, enabling Claude to systematically simulate each candidate option before choosing, like having an "internal simulation board."

## Verification Rules

Ensure all three engines executed — no skipping:

- ✅ Has divergence & convergence records → Diverge engine executed
- ✅ Simulation report count = solution count → Simulate engine executed
- ✅ Has decision report (with self-check + blindspot audit) → Converge engine executed

## Three Operating Modes

| Mode | When | Flow |
|------|------|------|
| **Full** | ≤5 solutions | Enumerate → multi-round simulate → aggregate → execute → TD update |
| **Quick** | >5 solutions | Rough filter → keep top 3~5 → simulate → aggregate → execute |
| **Re-simulate** | Unexpected during execution | Record TD error → re-simulate remaining → switch |

## 🚀 Activation Rules (Mandatory — Every Message)

**`alwaysApply: true` means this Skill executes on EVERY user message. No exceptions.**

### Step 0: Decompose First (Always)

Before anything else — before deciding "is this simple" or "do I need the engine" — decompose. The decomposition result decides the depth:

```
EVERY user message → immediately decompose:

  "Add user login"
    → Decision point analysis:
       Auth method? (JWT/Session/OAuth/...) → multiple choices ✓
       Frontend? (React/Vue/Native/...) → multiple choices ✓
       Password storage? (bcrypt/argon2) → only one valid choice ✗
    → At least 1 sub-need has options → start engine ✓

  "What is 1+1?"
    → Decision point analysis: No decision points, one answer
    → Direct answer, skip engine

  "Explain this code" (with code)
    → Decision point analysis: Pure explanation, no decisions
    → Direct explanation, skip engine

  "Hello"
    → Decision point analysis: Greeting, no task
    → Direct reply, skip engine
```

### Step 1: Activate Based on Decomposition

```
Decomposition result → Action:

  ≥1 sub-need has options → ⚡ Activate engine + enter diverge
  0 sub-needs have options → Direct answer, skip engine
  Insufficient info → Ask user, then re-decompose
```

### Activation Signal

When decomposition finds multi-option needs, output immediately:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
 ⚡ [MCTS-TD] Decision demand detected. Starting decision engine.
 Trigger: [which sub-need has multiple options]
 Mode: [full / quick]
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

### No Self-Doubt After Decomposition

```
★ If decomposition FOUND multiple options → ACTIVATE. No second-guessing. ★
★ If decomposition found ONLY ONE option → still output Phases 1~3, then state it at Phase 3. ★
```

### Step 1: Need Decomposition

If the user's message contains multiple independent needs, decompose first. Each sub-need independently goes through diverge→simulate→converge.

```
Decomposition principle: Find "decision points" — each point where an independent choice must be made.
  "Build me a blog with markdown support and comments"
    → Sub-need A: Blog framework choice | B: Markdown rendering | C: Comment system
  "Add user login to my app"
    → Single need, proceed directly to diverge
```

### Step 2: Diverge Engine — Diverge × Converge

**Detailed rules in `engine/mcts-diverge.md`**.

Diverge: Eight-Facet Mirror iterative review + cross-facet association → idea fragments + blindspot completion.
Converge: Cluster → Complete → Cull → Crystallize → 2~8 structured solutions.

### Step 3: Post-Convergence Decision

```
After convergence:
  ≥2 feasible solutions → Enter simulate engine
  Only 1 viable approach → Skip simulation, execute directly
  Insufficient information → Ask user, then re-diverge
```
