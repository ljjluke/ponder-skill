## ⚡ One Glance

```
Before: You ask → AI guesses → rewrites ×3 → frustrated
After:  You ask → AI simulates all options internally → picks the best → executes once ✅
```

> **Skip 3-5 rewrites per task. Think first, act once.**

| Pillar | What |
|--------|------|
| 🎯 **MCTS Tree Search** | Like AlphaGo — Selection → Expansion → Simulation → Backprop. Multi-round convergence on optimal path. |
| ⚖️ **Temporal Difference (TD)** | Learns from every execution. Gets smarter across sessions. |
| ☯️ **Eight-Facet Mirror** | Inspired by Taoist Bagua (八卦) — 8 universal perspectives ensure no blind spot. |
| 🗣️ **Language Adaptive** | Auto-detects the user's language — any language. English engine internally, user's language on display. Works for writing systems worldwide. |
| 🖥 **Node.js Native** | Zero extra deps. Cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux). Runs wherever Claude Code runs. |
| 🧠 **Human-like Memory** | Associative recall → fragment completion → external verification. Knowledge graph with state machine. |
| 🧠 **MMA Meridian Memory** | 12 meridians + 8 extraordinary vessels. Acupoint-based knowledge storage with Deqi recall and Ziwu Liuzhu context triggering. 7 human-like cognitive optimizations. |
| 🕵️ **Memory Agent (Sub-Agent)** | Silent observer — Court Historian (records) + Remonstrance Official (alerts). 5 auto-checkpoints. Watches entire session, alerts only on contradictions. |
| 🔒 **Compression-Safe** | Triple-layer rules (YAML + COMPRESSION-SAFE blocks + code enforcement). Survives long contexts. |
| ✅ **Self-Check + Blindspot Audit** | Questions its own conclusions before executing. Finds what you missed. |

## 🎯 What It Solves

### You've been here before

```
You: "Add user authentication to my app"
AI: OK → writes code immediately
You: "Uh, we can't use external dependencies..."
AI: Oh → deletes and rewrites
You: "Also, we're on MySQL only"
AI: OK → deletes and rewrites again
```

> **3 rewrites. Problem? Didn't think before acting.**

### With MCTS-TD Planner

```
You: "Add user authentication to my app"
AI: ⚡ Multiple approaches. Let me simulate first.
    → Collects constraints → Generates 3-5 solutions
    → Runs MCTS tree search on each → Picks the best
    → Writes it right the first time. ✅
```

> **One shot. Think first, act second.**

## ☯️ The Eight-Facet Mirror

Inspired by Taoist Bagua (八卦), the Eight-Facet Mirror ensures every decision is examined from 8 universal perspectives:

| Facet | Question |
|-------|----------|
| ☰ Source of Force | Where does the driving force come from? |
| ☷ Foundation & Capacity | What is the foundation this rests on? |
| ☳ Change & Disruption | Where might the unexpected happen? |
| ☴ Penetration & Diffusion | How does this actually reach people? |
| ☵ Risk & Abyss | Where is the deepest pit? Worst case? |
| ☲ Visible & Dependent | What's the shiny surface? What holds it up? |
| ☶ Boundary & Limit | What line cannot be crossed? |
| ☱ Convergence & Benefit | How to balance all interests? Win-win? |

> **The abstract framework never changes. The concrete dimensions are determined by the user's needs.**

## 🧠 MMA Meridian Memory System

Inspired by the human meridian system from the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (《黄帝内经》). Knowledge flows through 12 primary meridians like qi through channels. Each acupoint is a knowledge entry.

| Human ability | MMA Engine |
|--------------|------------|
| See problem → recall experience | Deqi (得气) — context resonates with acupoints, best matches emerge |
| Can't remember → piece together | Propagated Sensation (循经感传) — stimulate one point, sensation travels along meridian |
| Strong emotion → vivid memory | Emotion Modulator — fear +15, anger +10, joy +8 consolidation boost |
| Forget ≠ delete, just can't retrieve | Hidden Acupoint (隐穴) — marks hidden instead of deleting, can be awakened |
| Working memory 7±2 chunks | Triple Burner (三焦气化) — upper 7, middle session, lower historical |
| Sleep consolidates memory | Session End Replay (睡眠回放) — accelerated replay with emotion-weighted boost |
| Expert chunks patterns | Acupoint Clusters (腧穴集群) — co-occurring points auto-form knowledge chunks |
| Old knowledge outdated → correct | State machine — HYPOTHESIS→PROVISIONAL→CONFIRMED→DISPUTED→REFUTED→SLEEPING→ARCHIVED |
